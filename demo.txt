This file was created after the linkup of my VS Code with github
in orer to learn git Bash terminal

For git Uploading files is 2 step process 

1.add: it add a file at staged stage which means change is confirmed and file is ready to commit or be uploaded.
2.Commit: it finally uploads the file on git.


Untracked: New files which is not tracked by git
modified: The files in changes have been made or modified
staged: File added to git and ready to be committed
Unmodified: File which is unchanged or same on git and local file

new or modified file is added to staged state by using 
    git add <File Name>         (Used to add a single file to staged stage)
    OR
    git add .                   (Used to add all the new or modified files to stagged stage)
to commit a  changes: 
    git commit -m "<Message>for the commit is written"

to upload all the commit files on github push command is used.

    git push origin main
        Above command is used to push or upload the changes on github
        where, origin is the name which refers to the remote repository (While clonning a remote repository to local by default remoteRepo is named as origin)
        And, main is the name of branch in the remote repository
        
git push is used to make the changes or commited file available on github(from loacl to remote)
